# OMFG Quick Start Guide ðŸš€

Get your forked repository syncing with upstream in under 5 minutes!

## Step 1: Copy the Workflow File

1. In your forked repository, create the directory `.github/workflows/` if it doesn't exist
2. Copy the example workflow from [example-sync-fork.yml](../.github/workflows/example-sync-fork.yml)
3. Save it as `.github/workflows/sync-fork.yml` in your repository

## Step 2: Customize (Optional)

The workflow works out of the box, but you can customize:

```yaml
- name: Sync with upstream
  uses: GooseyPrime/OMFG@v1
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    # Add your customizations here:
    # upstream-repo: 'original-owner/repo-name'  # Usually auto-detected
    # dry-run: false
    # sync-workflows: true
    # conflict-strategy: 'merge'
```

## Step 3: Test the Action

### Manual Test
1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
2. Click "Sync Fork with Upstream" in the left sidebar
3. Click "Run workflow" â†’ "Run workflow"
4. Watch it run!

### Test in Dry-Run Mode
1. Click "Run workflow"
2. Check "Run in dry-run mode"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Review what would be changed without applying changes

## Step 4: Enable Automatic Syncing

The workflow runs daily at 6 AM UTC by default. You can change this by modifying the cron schedule:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 18 * * *'  # 6 PM UTC instead
```

## Common Customizations

### Sync Only Code (No Workflows)
```yaml
sync-code: true
sync-workflows: false
sync-secrets: false
```

### Require Manual Approval
```yaml
require-approval: true
conflict-strategy: 'fail'
```

### Custom File Patterns
```yaml
include-patterns: 'src/**,docs/**,*.md'
exclude-patterns: 'tests/**,*.log,node_modules/**'
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Could not auto-detect upstream repository"
Add the `upstream-repo` parameter:
```yaml
upstream-repo: 'original-owner/original-repo-name'
```

### "Permission denied"
Make sure your repository has the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions enabled in Settings â†’ Actions â†’ General.

### Viewing Sync Results
Check the "Summary" tab of any workflow run to see:
- Files changed
- Conflict details
- Complete change summary
